# Examples

## file names

To facilitate automatic sorting in the documentation, a file naming
convention is set forth for the examples.  The convention is to prefix
the file names.

prefix   | type of example
------   | -------
``geo_`` | diffractometer geometry example
``var_`` | variation on a geometry
``tst_`` | tests and comparisons
